# Shopping-Manager

This project was created for the IIT's 2nd year 1st semester OOP module coursework. The program is developed to manage an online shopping system. A console system is implimented from where the manager can add products, delete if needed, print and save them to a file. A graphical user interface implemented from where the user can select different products, add them to the shopping cart and visualize the discounted and final prices. The use of OOP concepts is clearly understandable and automated testing using JUnit for all main methods is implemented.
